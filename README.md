# RaspberryPiTestScripts
Collection of scripts I used when setting up a Raspberry PI rev B for Brewpi Remix

GPIOTest 

Just returns the value for a specific pin on the RPI, used this to get the default value for a pin I wanted to use for shutdown, and to make sure the value was changing when I connected it to a ground pin

Was used to test the temperature sensors to make sure they were functioning and not hardwired for parasitic mode only
